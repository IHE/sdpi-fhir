# sdpi-fhir / RI-TF-CA / Pilot - MBSE SysML Cameo / Example Models
Joint [IHE-HL7 Gemini Device Interoperability program](https://confluence.hl7.org/x/Xzf9Aw) in 2021 January looked at Year 3 and identifed 3 focus areas to address challenges around how profile requirements are managed, specifications are created and maintained, and how systems are tested for conformity.  In short:
	RI = Requirements Interoperability:  connecting requirements from one standard to capabilities in another, enabling traceability and coverage.
	
	MC = Model Centric:  Moving from a document-centric to a model-centric (MBSE/SysML) approach + enabling computable single-source-of-truth artifacts such as ReqIF specifications and HTML-based publication.
	
	R = Regulatory Ready:  System testing that leads to "regulatory submission ready" test reports & ISO 17000 program

This folder contains content related to this RI-TF-CA (Old name) 2021 initiative, MBSE/SYSML/Cameo pilot project.  MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering METHODOLOGY) / SysML (OMG Systems Modeling LANGUAGE) / Cameo (3DS Cameo Systems Modeler TOOL) lay the foundation for capturing these specifications in a model (model-centric) as opposed to a series of documents (document-centric) like Word, spreadsheets, diagrams, CSV files, etc.

Specifically, it captures various sample models that were collected or created during the pilot project, including one for a BICEPS Infusion Pump profile and another as an EARLY example of how the MDIRA might be specified in the model.
