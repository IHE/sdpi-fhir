# sdpi-fhir / White Paper:  Remote Connected Health / Mobile Health
Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini Project "Device Interoperability using SDPi+FHIR" artifacts.  This includes IHE Devices (DEV) Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) profiles and their "gateway" actor integration with HL7 FHIR, as well as associated white papers, educational materials (presentations, tutorials, etc.), test tooling, etc..  

This folder includes artifacts related to the white paper **Accelerating Safe Effective & Secure (SES) Remote Connected Health (RCC) / Mobile Health (MH) Solutions** that explores the question of how you can ensure during a rapid response scenario (e.g., pandemic scenarios) that a given solution is safe enough, effective enough and secure enough to be deployed for public use.  See [SDPi+FHIR "Paper:  SES RCC/MH"](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Paper%3A+++SES+Remote+Connected+Care+and+Mobile+Health) for more information.

The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.).  These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
