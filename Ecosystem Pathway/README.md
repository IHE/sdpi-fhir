# sdpi-fhir / Ecosystem Pathway
Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini Project "Device Interoperability using SDPi+FHIR" artifacts.  This includes IHE Devices (DEV) Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) profiles and their "gateway" actor integration with HL7 FHIR, as well as associated white papers, educational materials (presentations, tutorials, etc.), test tooling, etc.  

This folder includes artifacts related to the **Ecosystem Pathway (EP)** work stream that focuses on the Safe, Effective & Secure (SES) aspects of the Gemini SES MDI project.  Whereas, Medical Device Interoperability (MDI) is focused on the technical aspects of a system of device-to-device connected products, the SES aspect is focused on the process / quality / risk management / regulatory oversight aspects.  The EP work stream asks, "How will devcelopers of SDPi+FHIR products ensure that the resulting ecosystem of plug-and-trust components interoperate in a trustworthy manner?"  "What do those product development process pathways look like?"

Full information on the Ecosystem Pathway is available at [Pathway to an Ecosystem of Plug-and-Trust Products](https://confluence.hl7.org/x/XhPUB).
