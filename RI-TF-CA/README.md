# sdpi-fhir / RI-TF-CA
Joint [IHE-HL7 Gemini Device Interoperability program](https://confluence.hl7.org/x/Xzf9Aw) in 2021 January looked at Year 3 and identifed 3 focus areas to address challenges around how profile requirements are managed, specifications are created and maintained, and how systems are tested for conformity.  In short:
	RI = Requirements Interoperability:  connecting requirements from one standard to capabilities in another, enabling traceability and coverage.
	
	TF = Technical Framework:  how the TF specifications are created and maintained, moving from a document-centric to a model-centric approach + enabling computable artifacts such as ReqIF specifications and HTML-based publication.
	
	CA = Conformity Assessment:  System testing that leads to "regulatory submission ready" test reports & ISO 17000 program
