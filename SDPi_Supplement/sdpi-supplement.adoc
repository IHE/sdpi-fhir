This is a supplement to the IHE Devices Technical Framework Revision 10.0. Each supplement undergoes a process of public comment and trial implementation before being incorporated into the volumes of the Technical Frameworks.

__<For Public Comment:>__ This supplement is published on <Month XX, 201x> for Public Comment. Comments are invited and can be submitted at http://www.ihe.net/Public_Comment/#domainname. In order to be considered in development of the Trial Implementation version of the supplement, comments must be received by <Month XX, 201X>.

__<For Trial Implementation:>__ This supplement is published on <Month XX, 201X> for Trial Implementation and may be available for testing at subsequent IHE Connectathons. The supplement may be amended based on the results of testing. Following successful testing it will be incorporated into the Devices Technical Framework. Comments are invited and can be submitted at http://www.ihe.net/Public_Comment/#domainname.

This supplement describes changes to the existing technical framework documents.

“Boxed” instructions like the sample below indicate to the Volume Editor how to integrate the relevant section(s) into the relevant Technical Framework volume.
|===
|__Amend section W.X by the following:__
|===

Where the amendment adds text, make the added text bold underline. Where the amendment removes text, make the removed text bold strikethrough. When entire new sections are added, introduce with editor’s instructions to “add new text” or similar, which for readability are not bolded or underlined.

== Announce Network Presence [DEV-23]

=== Scope

This transaction is used to notify all SOMDS Consumer that a service provider system is connected to the network and ready to exchange messages with other SOMDS Participants.

=== Actor Roles

==== BICEPS Announce Network Presence Message

The AnnounceNetworkPresence() message is part of the SDC/BICEPS “implicit discovery” protocol for allowing SOMDS Consumer systems to receive a notification when a SOMDS Provider system is ready to receive messages from other SOMDS Consumer systems.  This is a broadcast message that is sent from each provider system to all listening consumer systems (zero to many).  Limited but sufficient information is provided with the message to enable consumer systems to determine if they are interested in connecting with the provider discovering additional information.  Note that additional information may be provided to better facilitate the discovery process.

==== Trigger Events

This message is sent whenever

1. SOMDS Provider system is connected to a network (see <<dev_23_picture>>), or
2. when it is returning to normal “on-line” operation after having indicated temporary suspension of SOMDA exchanges (e.g., issuing a __Announce Network Departure [DEV-34] transaction)__.
