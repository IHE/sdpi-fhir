# SDPi_Supplement / dev-review
This folder is intended to be a temporary container for versions of the SDPi Supplement HTML that are published for IHE DEV Internal review purposes.  

File names should be:  sdpi_supplement_<date>_<letter> 

For example, sdpi_supplement_20221214A.html 

NOTE:  The files in this directory are for temporary purposes only; ultimately, tagged versions of the supplement sources and renderings for review will be contained in a new DEV.SDPi repository.
