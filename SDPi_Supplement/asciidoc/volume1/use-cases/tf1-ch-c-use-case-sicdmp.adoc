=== Use Case Feature {var_use_case_id}: Standalone ICU Dashboard Multiple Patient (SICDmp)

==== Narrative

Dr. Presky is in the ICU evaluating a trauma patient from a remote location in the ICU.  The dashboard allows access to multiple patients, so he first needs to select the patient of interest.  This can be done by location or by patient name (if available).

He can view previous radiology results, electrosurgical equipment settings, patient readings such as HR, Blood Pressure, SpO2 and associated waveforms integrated on his real-time ‘Dashboard’ display.  The dashboard display can display visual alarms but does not sound alerts or provide any remote-control capabilities.  (This display can be considered an xDISmp as described in <<vol1_appendix_c_60601_1_8_concepts_for_dis_das_cdas>>.)

==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using a common <<acronym_md_lan>> protocol

*And* At least one ICU Dashboard display

*And* Devices from specific ICU rooms have been assigned to the Dashboard


==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: SICDmp {var_use_case_id}.1 - ICU Devices are Accessible to the Dashboard

*Given* Dashboard has detected at least one assigned accessible ICU device

*When* the ICU Devices are communicating on the <<acronym_md_lan>>

*Then* the Dashboard will display parameter, waveform, setting, alarm, imaging, etc. information from those devices (based on configuration)

===== Scenario: SICDmp {var_use_case_id}.2 - ICU Devices are Inccessible to the Dashboard

*Given* Dashboard cannot detect any assigned accessible ICU devices

*Then* the Dashboard will display an error message

===== Scenario: SICDmp {var_use_case_id}.3 - One or more ICU Devices are Inccessible to the Dashboard

*Given* Dashboard cannot detect any previously assigned accessible ICU devices

*Then* the Dashboard will display an error message
