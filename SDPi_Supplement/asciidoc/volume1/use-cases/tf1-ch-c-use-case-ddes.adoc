=== Use Case Feature {var_use_case_id}: Device Data to Enterprise Systems (DDES)

// ISSUE WITH WHERE TO DECLARE THESE DEFINITIONS (See definitions at end of Glossary file)
//[[acronym_ddes,DDES]]
//[[use_case_label_ddes,Device Data to Enterprise Systems]]

==== Narrative

Mercy Hospital is in the middle of a new <<acronym_ehr>> (Epic, Cerner, etc.) rollout.  Joe Furst is responsible for integrating data from their ICU devices (patient monitors, ventilators, infusion devices, etc.) with the new <<acronym_ehr>>.  Once they are done, the data from the devices will be reviewed/validated by the ICU clinicians and then automatically entered into the patientâ€™s clinical record.

==== Benefits
Automatically feeding patient data from the medical devices to medical record applications reduces the documentation burden on the clinicians, improves the accuracy of the medical record and enables 'real-time' analysis of the data which can be used to generate (potentially AI based) smart alerts to the clinical staff.

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_ddes_technical_precondition]
==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using a common <<acronym_md_lan>> protocol

*And* There is at least one Data <<system_type_device_gateway>> (<<acronym_dgw>>) Service

*And* All devices report either a device label and/or location

*And* A DGW Service is associated with a specific set of device labels, and/or location(s) (i.e. devices in scope).

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_ddes_scenarios]
==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: DDES {var_use_case_id}.1 - New in scope device is connected to network with MGW service

*Given* The DGW Service has detected a new in scope device

*When* The DGW Service is operational

*Then* The DGW Service will connect to the device and export data to the EHR using the HL7 v2 based IHE DEV DOR actor of the DEV DEC profile

#TODO:  REMOVE EXPLICIT PROFILE REFERENCES; let profiles link to gateway actors & profile roles#


===== Scenario: DDES {var_use_case_id}.2 - Data Gateway Service is connected to the EHR

*Given* The DGW Service is exporting data to the EHR

*Then* The DGW Service will comply with all IHE DEV DEC profile DOR actor functional and test requirements.

===== Scenario: DDES {var_use_case_id}.3 - Data Gateway Service has a failure

*Given* The DGW Service was connected to in scope devices and to an Enterprise system and fails

*Then* The DGW Service will backfill its data store and then backfill to the EHR when it recovers from its failure

===== Scenario: DDES {var_use_case_id}.4 - Data Gateway Service connection to the Enterprise System fails

*Given* The Enterprise System stops receiving data from the DGW Service

*When* There is a communications failure between the DGW Service and the Enterprise System

*Then* The DGW Service will backfill missed data to the Enterprise System when communications resumes
