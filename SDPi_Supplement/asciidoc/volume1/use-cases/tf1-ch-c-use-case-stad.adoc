=== Use Case Feature: SYNCHRONIZED TIME ACROSS DEVICES (SCAD)

// C.2.1
==== Narrative:
Nurse Jean attaches a ventilator to the SDC based network in the ICU.  It automatically synchronizes its clock with the clocks of the other devices on the network.

// C.2.2
==== Technical View

##TODO:  Add graphic here##

// C.2.3
==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using SDC

*And* NTP service on the SDC network

// C.2.4
==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: STAD 1.1 - Device is connected to network with NTP service

*Given* Device has detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is operational

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the NTP service time

===== Scenario: STAD 1.2 - Device is connected to network with a failed NTP server

*Given* Device has not detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is not operational or inaccessible

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with another SDC device in the cluster

===== Scenario: STAD 1.3 - Device is connected to network with NTP server and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is operational

*And* The time at another device is changed manually (maybe this is disallowed?)

*Then* The device will continue to synchronize its time with the NTP service time

===== Scenario: STAD 1.4 - Device is connected to network with a failed NTP server and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has not detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is not operational or inaccessible

*And* The time at another device is changed manually

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the time from the SDC device that had its time changed
