[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_stad_technical_precondition]
==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using a common <<acronym_md_lan>> protocol

*And* A Time Source (TS) Service is on the <<acronym_md_lan>> network

[#vol1_clause_appendix_c_use_case_stad_scenarios]
==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.1 - Device is connected to network with a Time Source service

*Given* Device has detected at least one <<acronym_ts_service>>

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is operational

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the <<acronym_ts_service>>

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.2 - Device is connected to network with a <<acronym_ts_service>> and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has detected at least one <<acronym_ts_service>>

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is operational

*And* The time at another device is changed manually

*Then* The device will continue to synchronize its time with the <<acronym_ts_service>>

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.3 - Device is connected to network and cannot connect to a <<acronym_ts_service>>

*Given* Device has just connected to the network and has not detected any <<acronym_ts_service>>s

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is not operational or inaccessible

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with another  device on the network

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.4 - Device is connected to network but cannot connect to a Time Source server and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has not detected any <<acronym_ts_service>>s

*When* The <<acronym_ts_service>> is not operational or inaccessible

*And* The time at another device is changed manually

*Then* The devices on the network will synchronize their time with the time from the device that had its time changed
