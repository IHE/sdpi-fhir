=== Use Case Feature {var_use_case_id}: Synchronized Time Across Devices (STAD)

==== Narrative:
Nurse Jean attaches a ventilator to the SDC based network in the ICU.  It automatically synchronizes its clock with the clocks of the other devices on the network.

==== Technical View

##TODO:  Add graphic here##

==== Technical Pre-Conditions

*Given* All devices communicate using SDC

*And* NTP service on the SDC network

==== Scenarios

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.1 - Device is connected to network with NTP service

*Given* Device has detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is operational

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the NTP service time

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.2 - Device is connected to network with a failed NTP server

*Given* Device has not detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is not operational or inaccessible

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with another SDC device in the cluster

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.3 - Device is connected to network with NTP server and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is operational

*And* The time at another device is changed manually (maybe this is disallowed?)

*Then* The device will continue to synchronize its time with the NTP service time

===== Scenario: STAD {var_use_case_id}.4 - Device is connected to network with a failed NTP server and a second device’s time setting is changed manually

*Given* Device has not detected at least one NTP service

*When* The NTP service is not operational or inaccessible

*And* The time at another device is changed manually

*Then* The device will synchronize its time with the time from the SDC device that had its time changed
