= Referenced Standards Requirements Conformance Support

NOTE:  This file contains the general introduction to how SDPi handles standards conformance + integrates sections for each standard "ICS" statement. +
{empty} +
ICS Statements per standard may be in a different subfolder and files - along with this appendix B file.

CAUTION:  This appendix may be deferred to SDPi 1.x


NOTE: the following section was moved from the mothership document to here for incorporation toward the front of Appendix C.
