====== Coded Attribute

BICEPS does not provide means to generically add attributes from the first partition of the IEEE 11073-10101 nomenclature to the MDIB.
This becomes challenging if there are attributes required by <<actor_somds_provider>>s to provide information that is not covered by the BICEPS participant model.

For example, BICEPS only supports the following MDS meta information below the `pm:Mds/pm:MetaData` element:

* UDI
* Lot number
* Manufacturer name
* Expiration date
* Model name
* Model number
* Serial number

Some statically configured meta information like firmware versions or software versions can be added by means of production specification elements.
However, attributes like equipment labels do not exist and cannot be conveyed by using production specifications.

This profile specifies the _Coded Attribute_ extension that allows for a <<actor_somds_provider>> to provide attributes from the first partition of the IEEE 11073-10101 nomenclature for which there is no information item specified in the BICEPS participant model.

====== Model

The CodedAttribute XML Schema is available in <<vol3_xml_schema_coded_attribute>>. <<vol3_example_extension_coded_attribute>> shows an exemplary XML instance of a <<vol2_clause_dev_30_message_getmdibresponse, {var_label_dev_30_message_getmdibresponse}>> including the `MDC_ATTR_ID_SOFT` attribute as an additional metadata item.

****
A <<actor_somds_provider>> shall set `sdpi:MdcAttribute/@Code` to any code from the first partition of the IEEE 11073-10101 nomenclature in the range of 67841 (1::2305) to 68609 (1::3073).
