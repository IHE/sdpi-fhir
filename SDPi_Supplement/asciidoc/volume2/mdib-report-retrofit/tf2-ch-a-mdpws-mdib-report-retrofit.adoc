==== MDIB Report Retrofit

In addition to <<vol3_clause_mdib_report_retrofit>>, this section specifies requirements to an MDPWS transport binding. The requirements aim to verify that <<acronym_mdib>> versions received by a <<actor_somds_consumer>> are not decremented and present no gap.

.R1001
[sdpi_requirement#r1001,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_provider>> shall only establish one TCP connection at a time for every subscribed <<actor_somds_consumer>>.
****

.R1002
[sdpi_requirement#r1002,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_participant>> shall utilize TCP to exchange messages with other <<actor_somds_participant>>s except for messages exchanged in the WS-Discovery Ad-hoc mode.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The WS-Discovery Ad-hoc mode utilizes UDP to exchange messages, see <<ws_discovery_2009>>.
====
****

.R1003
[sdpi_requirement#r1003,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_participant>> shall only utilize HTTP 1.1 without HTTP pipelining for any HTTP traffic.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: Enforces use of HTTP 1.1 in order to limit choices by which a re-ordering of message delivery can be implemented.
====
****

.R1004
[sdpi_requirement#r1004,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
A <<actor_somds_provider>> shall transmit msg:WaveformStream, msg:AbstractMetricReport, msg:AbstractOperationalStateReport, msg:AbstractComponentReport, msg:AbstractAlertReport, msg:ObservedValueStream, msg:DescriptionModificationReport, and msg:AbstractContextReport messages sequentially.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: This allows for a <<actor_somds_consumer>> to apply report data on internal <<acronym_mdib>> data structures before receiving the next report without buffering.
====
****

.R1005
[sdpi_requirement#r1005,sdpi_req_level=should]
****
A <<actor_somds_consumer>> should reconnect or go into a fail-safe mode when it receives a report with an <<acronym_mdib>> version that is either lower than the last received version or more than one version higher than the last received version.
****
