[discrete#message-announce-network-presence]
===== {var-label-dev-23-message-announce-network-presence}

The {var-label-dev-23-message-announce-network-presence} message is part of the BICEPS _implicit discovery_ protocol for allowing <<actor-somds-consumer>>s to receive a notification when a <<actor-somds-provider>> is ready to exchange messages with other <<actor-somds-consumer>>s.

The {var-label-dev-23-message-announce-network-presence} is a broadcast message that is sent from each <<actor-somds-provider>> to all listening <<actor-somds-consumer>>s (zero to many). Limited but sufficient information is provided with the message to enable <<actor-somds-consumer>>s to determine if they are interested in connecting with the <<actor-somds-provider>> discovering additional information.

[discrete#message-announce-network-presence-trigger-events]
====== {var-label-trigger-events}

This message is sent

1. whenever a <<actor-somds-provider>> joins a network, or
2. when it is returning to normal _on-line_ operation after having indicated temporary suspension of message exchanges.

[discrete#message-announce-network-presence-message-semantics]
====== {var-label-message-semantics}

[[payload-dev-23-provider-uid]]Provider UID:: A globally unique identifier for the <<actor-somds-provider>>.
[[payload-dev-23-discovery-scope]]Discovery Scope:: A scope for basic filtering.

[discrete#message-announce-network-presence-expected-actions]
====== {var-label-expected-actions}

When a <<actor-somds-provider>> sends this message, there is no expected or required responses. This is due to the fact that either there are no <<actor-somds-consumer>>s listening for announcement messages, or the information in the message (e.g., Discovery Type) is not of interest to any receiving <<actor-somds-consumer>>s.
