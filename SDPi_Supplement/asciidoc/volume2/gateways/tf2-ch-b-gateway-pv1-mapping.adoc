===== PV1 - Patient Visit Segment
The HL7 Patient Visit (PV1) segment requires a mapping from the SDC patient and location context information to the PV1 segment fields.

====== Prerequisite of Valid Patient & Location Context

.R8111
[sdpi_requirement#r8111,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
The SDC patient and location context information shall only be mapped to the corresponding fields in the HL7 PV1 segment when the requirements (e.g. inferred patient and/or location ensemble context, associated patient and/or location context, etc.) as defined in the <<ref_ieee_11073_10700_2022>> are fulfilled.

If the SDC patient and/or location context information is not be used for the mapping, please refer to the <<ref_ihe_pcd_tf_2_2019>> on how to populate the fields of the PV1 segment in this case.
****

====== PV1-2 Patient Class
.R8112
[sdpi_requirement#r8112,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> shall set the PV1-2 field to the code for the patient class.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: The *HL7 table 0004 - Patient Class* defines a set of recommended codes to be used for the data fields of the HL7 data type *IS* used in the PV1-2 field.
====
****

Usually, a PoC device is used for patients admitted to a care unit in the hospital, and therefore, the field shall be set to *"I"* (Inpatient). If the patient class is unknown, the field shall be set to *"U"* (Unknown).

The SDC data model does not support the concept of a patient class. Therefore, the field shall either be set to *"U"* (Unknown) by default, or set to a configurable value by the gateway.

====== PV1-3 Assigned Patient Location
.R8113
[sdpi_requirement#r8113,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> shall set the PV1-3 field to the patient's assigned location.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: <<ref_tbl_pv13_mapping>> defines the mapping of the SDC patient location information to the data fields of the HL7 data type *PL* used in the PV1-3 field.

====== PV1-19 Visit Number
.R8114
[sdpi_requirement#r8114,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> shall set the PV1-19 field to the patient's visit identifier.

If the SDC patient identifier element *pm:PatientContextState/pm:Identification* contains more than one patient identifier, only the unique identifier assigned to the patient's visit is mapped according to the <<ref_tbl_pv119_mapping>> table.

When there is no unique visit identifier assigned to the patient's visit, the field is left empty.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: <<ref_tbl_pv119_mapping>> defines the mapping of the SDC patient identifier to the data fields of the HL7 data type *CX* used in the PV1-19 field.

NOTE: A visit identifier could be a visit number, an account number, or any other identifier that relates to the patient's visit.

Valid *"Identifier Type Code"* values for a visit number are, for example, *"VN"* (Visit Number), *"AN"* (Account Number), etc.

====== PV1-44 Admit Time / Date
.R8115
[sdpi_requirement#r8115,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> shall set the PV1-44 field to the patient's admission date/time.

The SDC data model does not support the concept of an admission date/time. There are also different types of admissions; e.g. hospital admission, care unit admission, etc.

This said, it is up to the <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> to figure out the admission date/time to be set in the PV1-44 field. If the gateway is not able to determine the admission date/time, the field is left empty.
****

====== PV1-51 Visit Indicator
.R8116
[sdpi_requirement#r8116,sdpi_req_level=shall,sdpi_max_occurrence=2]
****
A <<actor_somds_dec_gateway>> / <<actor_somds_acm_gateway>> shall set the PV1-51 field to the code for the visit indicator.

If *"pm:PatientContextState/pm:Identification/pm:Type/@Code"* is "VN" (Visit Number), the field is set to *"V"*.

Otherwise, the field is left empty by default.

NOTE: The HL7 table 0326 - Visit Indicator defines a set of recommended codes to be used for the data fields of the HL7 data type IS used in the PV1-51 field.
