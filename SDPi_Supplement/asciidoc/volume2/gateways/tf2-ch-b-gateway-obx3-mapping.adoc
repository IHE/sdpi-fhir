The OBX-3 field shall contain the identifier of the element in the hierarchical containment tree such as MDS, VMD, CHAN, or the actual related metric to be exported. The tables below defines the mapping of the SDC containment tree element to the data fields of the HL7 data type *CWE* used in the OBX-3 field.

[NOTE]
====
If a private *MDC* code is used for the coding of the SDC containment tree element, the identifier shall be mapped as described in section <<ref_private_coding_system_note>>.
