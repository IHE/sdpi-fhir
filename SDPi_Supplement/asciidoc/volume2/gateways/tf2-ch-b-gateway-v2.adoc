=== SDPi Gateway -- HL7 V2 General Mapping

*REVIEWER NOTE*:  The full specification of the IHE DEC and ACM profile mappings is defined in the *SDPi DEC Gateway — Mapping* and the *SDPi ACM Gateway — Mapping* sections.
Further content to this section will be editorially added during the review period.

*REVIEWER QUESTION*: #Issue HL7 Local Time vs. SDC UTC time: SDC requires that all timestamps are in UTC. The time zone is optional. In HL7 V2 all timestamps are local time and the time zone is optional as well. Do Device Observation Consumer (DOC) and Alarm Manager (AM) expect the gateway to convert UTC to local time?#
