==== Connection Time Delay

When a <<actor_somds_provider>> joins a network and sends out a <<vol2_clause_dev_23_message_hello, {var_label_dev_23_message_hello}>> message, depending on the number of <<actor_somds_consumer>>s that are interested in the data of that <<actor_somds_provider>>, the <<actor_somds_provider>> can get overwhelmed by incoming TCP connection requests and TLS handshakes. <<actor_somds_provider>>s and <<actor_somds_consumer>>s can implement different actions in order to avoid flooding of TCP connection requests and TLS handshakes under normal operating conditions. Each action comes with individual advantages and disadvantages.

===== Provider-controlled Delay

<<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>> normatively references <<ref_oasis_dpws_2009>> which in turn leverages <<ref_oasis_ws_discovery_2009>>> to provide distributed (ad-hoc) or centralized (managed) service registries. WS-Discovery decomposes into two message sequences, <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_23, implicit discovery>> and <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_24, explicit discovery>> of which implicit discovery can lead to loss of performance for <<actor_somds_provider>>s when multiple <<actor_somds_consumer>>s attempt to connect at the same time.


In order to suppress concurrent connection attempts, in the ad-hoc mode a <<actor_somds_provider>> can omit the <<term_transport_address>> from the {var_label_dev_23_message_hello} message. Subsequently, a <<actor_somds_consumer>> needs to send a {var_label_dev_24_message_resolve} message to resolve the <<actor_somds_provider>>'s <<term_transport_address>>.

[none]
* icon:plus[] Deferral is controlled by the entity that is affected by concurrent connection attempts.
* icon:minus[] The deferral does not work in managed mode, i.e. when a discovery proxy is in charge to respond to {var_label_dev_24_message_resolve} messages (unless the discovery proxy implements a similar behavior).

A <<actor_somds_provider>> may delay sending a Resolve Match response to a Resolve message.

NOTE: It is up to the <<term_manufacturer>> of the <<actor_somds_provider>> to choose a delay that fits the hardware capabilities of the <<actor_somds_provider>> for concurrent connection requests.

===== Consumer-controlled Delay

<<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>> proposes the concept of priority groups. If a priority group is configured for a <<actor_somds_consumer>>, it postpones initial connection requests once in retrieved the <<term_transport_address>> of a <<actor_somds_provider>>. Depending on the priority groups 0 to 9, with increasing group numbers the initial connection delay increases linearly based on random or fixed durations in predefined intervals.

<<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>> does not define numbers for specific purposes but rather appeal to <<term_manufacturer>>s to implement priority groups meaningful to their <<actor_somds_consumer>>'s purpose.

[none]
* icon:plus[] The deferral works in ad-hoc and managed mode discovery.
* icon:minus[] Deferral is not controlled by the entity that is affected by concurrent connection attempts but by the entity that initiates the connection.

.R0002
[sdpi_requirement#r0002,sdpi_req_level=should]
****
A <<actor_somds_consumer>> should be configurable with a priority group number in accordance with <<ref_ieee_11073_20701_2018>> R0076.

.Notes

====
NOTE: As it is not trivial to determine the priority of a <<actor_somds_consumer>> in all and every circumstance, the <<term_manufacturer>> can provide configurable options that allow for flexible adaptation on environmental changes.

====== Default Priority Group

.R0003
[sdpi_requirement#r0003,sdpi_req_level=shall]
****
If a <<term_manufacturer>> does not intend to enforce configuration of priority groups during installation of its <<actor_somds_consumer>>, the manufacturer shall pre-configure priority groups to a reasonable default value that reflects the highest criticality of the <<actor_somds_consumer>>'s system function.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: This does not necessarily prevent the user from changing the priority group after the installation process is finished.

NOTE: Guidelines for reasonable default values are shown in <<vol2_clause_appendix_a_mdpws_connect_time_algorithm_priority_groups>>.

====== Dynamic Priority Group

.R0004
[sdpi_requirement#r0004,sdpi_req_level=may]
****
If a <<term_manufacturer>> does not intend to allow for a user to configure a priority group after the installation process of its <<actor_somds_consumer>> is finished, the manufacturer may dynamically determine a reasonable priority group for its <<actor_somds_consumer>> according to the highest criticality of the <<actor_somds_consumer>>'s system function on startup.

.Notes
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: In order to dynamically determine the priority group within a certain range, a <<actor_somds_consumer>> can use, for example, a random number generator function or a real-time clock.

NOTE: Guidelines for reasonable priority group ranges are shown in <<vol2_clause_appendix_a_mdpws_connect_time_algorithm_priority_groups>>.

====== Priority Group Guidelines

<<vol2_clause_appendix_a_mdpws_connect_time_algorithm_priority_groups>> exhibits guidelines to <<term_manufacturer>>s or responsible organizations as to which priority group can be used for a certain <<actor_somds_consumer>> system function criticality.
