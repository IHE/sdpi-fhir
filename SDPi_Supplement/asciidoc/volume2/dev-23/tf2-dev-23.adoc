[#vol2_clause_dev_23_message_hello]
===== {var_label_dev_23_message_hello} Message

<<acronym_biceps>> specifies an implicit discovery protocol for allowing <<actor_somds_consumer>>s to receive a notification when a <<actor_somds_provider>> is ready to exchange messages with other <<actor_somds_consumer>>s.
The corresponding message for this transaction is called _{var_label_dev_23_message_hello}_.

Note that the {var_label_dev_23_message_hello} message described in this clause is a generic/abstract concept that can be implemented differently.
It should not be confused with actual transport message specifications like, e.g. the WS-Discovery Hello message as described in <<vol2_clause_appendix_mdpws_dev_23>>.

The {var_label_dev_23_message_hello} is a multicast message that is sent from each <<actor_somds_provider>> to all listening <<actor_somds_consumer>>s (zero to many). Limited but sufficient information is provided with the message to enable <<actor_somds_consumer>>s to determine if they are interested in connecting with the <<actor_somds_provider>> discovering additional information.

[#vol2_clause_dev_23_message_announce_network_presence_trigger_events]
====== Trigger Events

This message is sent

1. whenever a <<actor_somds_provider>> joins an <<acronym_md_lan>>,
2. when a <<actor_somds_provider>> returns to normal _on-line_ operation after having indicated temporary suspension of message exchanges, or
3. when a <<actor_somds_provider>> changes its <<payload_dev_23_discovery_scope>>.

[#vol2_clause_dev_23_message_announce_network_presence_message_semantics]
====== Message Semantics

[[payload_dev_23_provider_uid]]Provider UID:: The <<term_somds_provider_uid>>.
[[payload_dev_23_discovery_scope]]Discovery Scope:: The <<term_discovery_scope>> of the <<actor_somds_provider>>.

[#vol2_clause_dev_23_message_announce_network_presence_expected_actions]
====== Expected Actions

When a <<actor_somds_provider>> sends this message, there is no expected or required responses. This is due to the fact that either there are no <<actor_somds_consumer>>s listening for announcement messages, or the information in the message (e.g., Discovery Type) is not of interest to any receiving <<actor_somds_consumer>>s.
