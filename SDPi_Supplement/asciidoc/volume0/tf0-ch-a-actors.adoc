|New (or modified) Actor Name |Definition

|[[actor_biceps_content_consumer,BICEPS Content Consumer]] BICEPS Content Consumer

|Processes <<acronym_mdib>> information conformant to <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> BICEPS specifications provided by <<actor_biceps_content_creator>> systems.

|[[actor_biceps_content_creator,BICEPS Content Creator]] BICEPS Content Creator

|Provides <<acronym_mdib>> content conformant to <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>> BICEPS specification and for consumption by other <<actor_biceps_content_consumer>> systems.

|[[actor_somds_acm_gateway,SOMDS ACM Gateway]] SOMDS ACM Gateway

|A <<actor_somds_v2_gateway>> grouped actor that supports the bi-directional exchange of medical alert information with non-SOMDS systems and applications using IHE Alert Communication Management (ACM) transactions.

|[[actor_somds_connector,SOMDS Connector]] SOMDS Connector

|A <<actor_somds_participant>> that enables seamless interaction with systems and software applications that are outside the scope of the SOMDS network instance.  This abstract actor provides a consistent method for interacting, as a <<actor_somds_consumer>> and / or <<actor_somds_provider>>, with a specific SOMDS instance, as the foundation for protocol-specific gateway and platform actors.

|[[actor_somds_consumer,SOMDS Consumer]] SOMDS Consumer

|A <<actor_somds_participant>> that discovers and utilizes at least one service, functional capability, exposed to a network communications backbone by a <<actor_somds_provider>>. (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “SERVICE CONSUMER” and “SERVICE” definitions.)
Note:  A <<actor_somds_consumer>> is the primary actor providing communication for the <<actor_biceps_content_consumer>>.

|[[actor_somds_dec_gateway,SOMDS DEC Gateway]] SOMDS DEC Gateway

|A <<actor_somds_v2_gateway>> grouped actor that supports the bi-directional exchange of medical data using IHE Device Enterprise Communication (DEC) messages with non-SOMDS systems and applications.

|[[actor_somds_fhir_gateway,SOMDS FHIR Gateway]] SOMDS FHIR Gateway

|A <<actor_somds_connector>> that supports use of HL7 FHIR for interoperating with Non-SOMDS Systems.

|[[actor_somds_participant,SOMDS Participant]] SOMDS Participant

|A foundational abstract actor that provides the SOA architectural constructs for interoperating in a Service-Oriented Medical Device System (SOMDS) network instance, including information, messaging and dynamic behavior models.   (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “PARTICIPANT” definition)

|[[actor_somds_provider,SOMDS Provider]] SOMDS Provider

|A <<actor_somds_participant>> that provides at least one service to the other participant systems.  (See <<ref_ieee_11073_10207_2017>>  “SERVICE PROVIDER” definition)
Note:  A <<actor_somds_provider>> is the primary actor providing communication for the <<actor_biceps_content_creator>>.


|[[actor_somds_sensor_gateway,SOMDS Sensor Gateway]] SOMDS Sensor Gateway

|A _<<actor_somds_connector>>_  that supports integration of sensors external to a SOMDS network.

|[[actor_somds_smart_app_platform,SOMDS Smart App Platform]] SOMDS Smart App Platform

|A _<<actor_somds_connector>>_  that supports connection to a SOMDS network that is optimized for applications, including <<term_software_as_a_medical_device>>.

|[[actor_somds_v2_gateway,SOMDS V2 Gateway]] SOMDS V2 Gateway

|A _<<actor_somds_connector>>_ that supports use of HL7 Version 2 (V2) for interoperating with Non-SOMDS Systems.

.Complete List of Existing Actors Utilized in this Profile
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Existing Actor Name |Definition

|[[actor_alert_aggregator,Alert Aggregator]] Alert Aggregator  +
*_(TBD) -- If the ACM Gateway uses this_*
| This actor receives alerts from the Alert Reporter and collects status events related to the dissemination of the alert.

|[[actor_alert_consumer,Alert Consumer]] Alert Consumer  +
*_(TBD) -- If the ACM Gateway uses this_*
| The Alert Consumer (ACON) actor receives the alert from the Alert Reporter (AR) and uses the alert information strictly as a consumer of the alert being raised.  There is no implementation requirement for how the ACON ultimately uses the alert information.

|[[actor_alert_manager,Alert Manager]] Alert Manager  +
*_(TBD) External to the ACM Gateway ... but will be indicated ... externally ... include?_*
| The Alert Manager (AM) actor receives the alerts from the Alert Reporter (AR), potentially analyzes the alert, and dispatches the alert to the Alert Communicator (AC), and optionally, provides the alert to the Alert Archiver (AA) or Alert Consumer (ACON) upon subscription.

|[[actor_alert_reporter,Alert Reporter]] Alert Reporter
| This actor originates the alert (an alarm, either physiological or technical, or an advisory). May also query the Alert Aggregator for the status of the alert.

|[[actor_device_observation_consumer,Device Observation Consumer]] Device Observation Consumer  +
*_(TBD) Needed if any SOMDS-external info coming back; NOT IMPLEMENTED IN SDPi 1.0 but included in the actor diagram_*
| The actor responsible for receiving PCD data from the Device Observation Reporter, the Device Observation Filter, or both.

|[[actor_device_observation_reporter,Device Observation Reporter]] Device Observation Reporter
| The Device Observation Reporter (DOR) actor receives data from PCDs, including those based on proprietary formats, and maps the received data to transactions providing consistent syntax and semantics.


| Time Client +
*_(TBD -- Do dependent profile actors like CT TC get included in this table?)_*
| Establishes time synchronization with one or more Time Servers using the NTP protocol and either the NTP or SNTP algorithms.  Maintains the local computer system clock synchronization with UTC based on synchronization with the Time Servers.
