# sdpi-fhir / SDPi_Supplement

This folder includes artifacts related to the **IHE DEV TF SDPi Supplement**, including all artifacts that are included in the development of the draft supplement document.  See [SDPi+FHIR "Specifications:  SDPi IHE Profiles"](hhttps://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Specifications%3A++SDPi+IHE+ProfilesR) for more information.  Information and guidance on how the SDPi Supplement content is authored, especially using [AsciiDoc.org](https://asciidoc.org/), consult the [repository wiki articles](https://github.com/IHE/sdpi-fhir/wiki).

Also, there are handy SDPi content editors support articles:
* [IHE TF Editors AsciiDoc Cookbook](sdpi-article-ihe-tf-asciidoc-cookbook.adoc) 
* [SDPi Editors AsciiDoc Cheat Sheet](sdpi-article-asciidoc-cheat-sheet.adoc)

The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.).  These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
