# sdpi-fhir / SDPi_Supplement
Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini Project "Device Interoperability using SDPi+FHIR" artifacts.  This includes IHE Devices (DEV) Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) profiles and their "gateway" actor integration with HL7 FHIR, as well as associated white papers, educational materials (presentations, tutorials, etc.), test tooling, etc..  

This folder includes artifacts related to the **IHE DEV TF SDPi Supplement**, including all artifacts that are included in the development of the draft supplement document.  See [SDPi+FHIR "Specifications:  SDPi IHE Profiles"](hhttps://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Specifications%3A++SDPi+IHE+ProfilesR) for more information.

The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.).  These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
