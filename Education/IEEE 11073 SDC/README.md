# sdpi-fhir / Education / IEEE 11073 SDC
Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini Project "Device Interoperability using SDPi+FHIR" artifacts.  This includes IHE Devices (DEV) Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) profiles and their "gateway" actor integration with HL7 FHIR, as well as associated white papers, educational materials (presentations, tutorials, etc.), test tooling, etc..  

This folder includes artifacts related to **IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) educational presentations** that were originally presented in 2018 as part of an IEEE 11073 SDC Webinar series.

***DISCLAIMER:  **The presentations in this folder are from 2018 and are Revision 1.0.  Consult the latest versions of the standards and the IHE SDPi Supplement specifications for up-to-date information.  That said, the information presented here remains highly accurate and useful!*****



The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.).  These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
