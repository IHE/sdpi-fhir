# sdpi-fhir / FHIR Integration
Joint IHE-HL7 Gemini Project "Device Interoperability using SDPi+FHIR" artifacts.  This includes IHE Devices (DEV) Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) profiles and their "gateway" actor integration with HL7 FHIR, as well as associated white papers, educational materials (presentations, tutorials, etc.), test tooling, etc..  

This folder includes artifacts related to **FHIR Integration** that support the intersection between SDC/SDPi-based connectivity and FHIR-based exchanges.  This includes mappings between SDC/SDPi & FHIR / Devices on FHIR (DoF).  Note that formal DoF Implementation Guides (IG) are integrated into the HL7-based repositories.  See [SDPi+FHIR "Devices on FHIR"](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/GP/Specifications%3A++Devices+on+FHIR) for more information.

The primary focus of the IHE DEV SDPi profiles are device-to-device plug-n-trust interoperability around high-acuity point-of-care contexts (e.g., operating room, ICU, emergency room bed, etc.).  These SDPi profiles leverage the ISO/IEEE 11073 Service-oriented Device Connectivity (SDC) standards.
